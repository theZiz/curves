# Hi and welcome to the "curves Makefile". This Makefile is for compiling
# curves on unix based systems or Windows with Mingw32/Cygwin (not tested)

# === First of all some defines. If your compilation is slow or instable, check
# === the defines and changes them for your Target.

# -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION enables a faster multiplication for fixed point
# arithmetics, it may look ugly on bigger resolution or may be too inaccurate.

# -DFAST_DIVISION does the same as -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION, but for division.

# -DDEBUG shows some debug informations => slower and may be confusing

# === Now some globale variables. These are the default values for compilation on
# === a Linux machine. The other targets then change, where their have differences

# DYNAMIC says, which libraries will be linked dynamicly. Most of the time these
# are all used libraries, but some systems also need static linking, too. Because
# as default no library is linked static, STATIC is not defined yet.
DYNAMIC = -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_ttf -lSDL_image -lSDL -lm -lsparrow3d

# CFLAGS defines some globale flags for gcc. Even on the gp2x with only 16 KB
# CPU Cache, -O3 is faster than -Os. So most things you don't have to change
CFLAGS = -O2 -fsingle-precision-constant -fPIC

# GENERAL_TWEAKS are some flags for gcc, which should make the compilation
# faster, but some of them are just poinsoness snake oil - they may help a bit,
# but could also kill you. ^^
GENERAL_TWEAKS = -ffast-math -DDEBUG

# every device using SMALL_RESOLUTION_DEVICES in the compilation will enable
# the faster multiplication and division
SMALL_RESOLUTION_DEVICES = -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION -DFAST_DIVISION

# The default Compiler is gcc with debug symbols and a X86CPU (that's a define
# for sparrow or your game, not used by gcc.
CPP = gcc -g -march=native -DX86CPU $(GENERAL_TWEAKS)

# SDL sets some SDL options with the program "sdl-config".
SDL = `sdl-config --cflags`

# SPARROW_LIB determines, where the sparrow library is.
SPARROW_LIB = -L../sparrow3d

# SPARROW_INCLUDE determines, where the sparrow includes are
SPARROW_INCLUDE = -I../sparrow3d

# SDL_PATH determines, where the SDL includes are (necessary if SDL is in subfolders)
SDL_PATH = -I/usr/include/SDL

# INCLUDE determines, where all the other includes are
# INCLUDE = -I/usr/include

# LIB determines, where all the other libraries are
# LIB = -L/usr/lib

# Where to put the executables to?
# BUILD_PATH = ./build/

# === The Targets. Set your own paths on your PC!
# == GP2X/WIZ ==
